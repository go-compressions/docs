Pure-Go, **cgo-free** `b3sum` — print and verify **BLAKE3** checksums of files
and stdin. Output is compatible with the reference
[`b3sum`](https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3): `<hex>  <name>`. A single
static binary, no C toolchain. Built on
[go-compressions/blake3](https://github.com/go-compressions/blake3).

## Usage

```console
$ b3sum file.iso
e3b0c442...  file.iso

$ b3sum *.tar.gz > SUMS
$ b3sum --check SUMS
archive-1.tar.gz: OK
archive-2.tar.gz: OK

$ printf abc | b3sum --no-names
6437b3ac38465133ffb63b75273a8db548c558465d79db03fd359c6cd5bd9d85
```

```
b3sum [--length N] [--no-names] [FILE...]   # hash files (or stdin with - / none)
b3sum --check [FILE...]                      # verify checksums read from FILE(s)
```

- `--length N`, `-l N` — output N bytes (default 32).
- `--check`, `-c` — verify `<hex>  <name>` lines; prints `<name>: OK` / `FAILED`,
  exits non-zero on any mismatch.
- `--no-names` — print only the digest.

## Performance

`b3sum` hashes each file in one shot, so it rides the underlying library's
multi-core SIMD kernels. As of blake3 **v0.5.0** the **default build is
SIMD-accelerated on all six 64-bit targets** — cgo-free, no `GOEXPERIMENT` —
using [go-asmgen](https://github.com/go-asmgen/asmgen)-generated assembly for the
`mix4` round function: NEON (arm64), SSE2 (amd64), LSX (loong64), RVV (riscv64),
VSX (ppc64le) and the vector facility (s390x, big-endian). It is bit-identical to
the scalar path (verified against the official BLAKE3 vectors) and falls back to
scalar for small inputs. b3sum inherits all six arches with no code change; the
ppc64le and s390x paths are qemu-validated (correct + bit-identical), native
throughput pending hardware.

Hashing a 1 GiB file (Apple Silicon, page cache warm):

| build | time | throughput | speedup |
|---|---|---|---|
| scalar (blake3 ≤ v0.3.0) | ~0.51 s | ~2.0 GB/s | 1.0× |
| **SIMD (blake3 ≥ v0.4.0, default)** | **~0.34 s** | **~3.0 GB/s** | **~1.5×** |

The underlying per-chunk kernel is ~3–4× faster than scalar; end-to-end b3sum
gains less because of file I/O and the tree/parent hashing. No flags needed.

### Alternative: archsimd build

The library also has a second SIMD implementation using Go's experimental
`simd/archsimd` intrinsics (amd64 AVX2 on Go 1.26+, arm64 on Go 1.27+). A
`…-simd-experimental` amd64 binary is published alongside the defaults for
comparison:

```sh
GOEXPERIMENT=simd go build ./cmd/b3sum
```
